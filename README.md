# Articles
These are the articles from KentBarrett.com, mostly by Scott Duncan.

These files have been converted to md (from the Wordpress-generated html).

These are for use in the Tender For Law reconstruction project, but they're also pretty interesting for anyone just to read, if you care about money and law and such.

Note: Tweaking will be required. There are dead links in these (to Facebook entries mostly), and any image links are hard-coded to files on kentbarrett.com.
