I have been asked by Scott Duncan to describe what it was that "convinced" me that I would get the truth from him in his Facebook (!) group, *The Tender For Law*.

There is a lot to the long story of how I came to this, some of which I'll go into here, but the TL;DR is

**1. He does not lie**  
And he's always right. You ~~may~~ will find this annoying, but your feelings don't change facts.  

**2. He says "Trust, but VERIFY"**  
Seriously, what kind of "Cult Leader" does *that*?  

**3. He has nothing to sell**  
He has no DVDs for you to buy. There are no seminars you can purchase tickets to. There's no paid "Members Only" secret mailing list. He doesn't sell prayer mats, ointments, vitamin supplements or erection pills. He has made it clear from the beginning that us knowing these things advances his own agenda, and that is the *only* reason we have even heard of him.

**4. The Tender For Law**  
Right there in the title of the group is the one thing that *every* FreeDumber guru, every "secret codes" charlatan, and every last New Age woo-fucker you've ever heard of completely misses. 

The reason they miss it is because they do not know what money *is* (though they continuously ask you for more of it) and they do not know that "legal tender" is "not" money, it is what is *attached* to money that you use every day.

### So... how did I get here?

I have listened to and read stuff by just about every FreeDumb quack that has popped up this century (and in one infamous episode worked tirelessly for years for one of them). 

To name a few: Robert Menard (inventor of the Peanut Butter Theory of money, and author of a dozen scams), Dean Clifford (who spent years in the lockup thanks to his advanced legal "knowledge"), ~~Santos~~ Sam Bonacci (who through decades of staring at astrology charts made the breakthrough discovery that the position of the sun relative to the Earth moves north and south in a *cycle*), Winston Shrout (who thought he had secret "tricks" in commerce all figured out), John Spirit (who is Eternally aware, doncha know) Wally Dove (who had a Magic Parchment cure-all), The One People's Public ~~Trust~~ Fraud, and I shouldn't forget Mary Croft (who at least understood that money is debt there's a difference between *money of account* and *money of exchange*).

I've also seen outrageous bullshit on Youtube and various websites by cretins such as the Faggot Piss-Drinker Guy, The Buck 'o' Five Guy, the Guy who lives in his truck, the whack-job Christian Guy Who Was Mad About His Birds, and just endless masturbation by ‘Cestui Que Vie’ conspiracy theorists and modern parchment-worshippers such as Derek Moran.

Yes, I was exposed to one pantload of crap before finally winding up in The Tender For Law.

And why? Why would I put myself through all of this at a time in my life when I should be writing memoirs and publishing charming coffee-table art books?

Because something was wrong in the world. And I didn't know what it was. As long as I can remember I knew that what I was told about how the world worked and how it actually worked were different things. I knew I was being lied to all the time. But everybody went along with it. (sniff) I felt so alone. 

I watched as government control over people increased and increased and increased... this was no longer a free country! It was totalitarian nightmare happening right in front of me: everything was getting WORSE, when science should have been making everything continuously BETTER. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!?

Then I saw [Money As Debt](https://youtu.be/1Xs20X_uXL8).

Then I got somewhat angry and went looking for answers and thus began my adventures in FreeDumb Land.

### So... what convinced you about Scott?

There's no one moment or event I can point to. I can tell you it was immediately apparent that this guy was not just different, but unique. He obviously knew a lot about law, and money, and computers, and people. We'll take my points from above.

**1. He does not lie**  
Here in The Tender For Law you could ask any question. He did not prevaricate, give a mumbled half-answer, ignore you, change the topic or imply slyly that he knew, but couldn't reveal it at this time.

He simply gave you the answer, and it was always right. He'd point you to the relevent act or statute and, once you'd looked up every LEGAL definition involved, you'd see it said exactly what he had told you.

If he was asked the same question months or years later, his answer was identical. "Constant as the Northern Star" is the appropriate expression.

**2. He says "Trust, but VERIFY"**  
This is obviously related to #1 above. You will waste precious time from your life wondering *if* he is right. I'm quite serious. He always is. He knows more than you and he's not lying. Accept that.

So the smartest thing for you to do is to trust that what he tells you is *true*, but then *verify* it. Until you verify for yourself, you will not understand, you'll just have memorised some words that some guy said.

**3. He has nothing to sell**  
Scott's not selling anything. At all. No newsletters, no donation box... he doesn't want your money. He doesn't even want to be your "friend" on Facebook. 

This is the dead give-away on every FreeDumber site: they have stuff to sell you. Whatever they are spouting about freedom from government, yadda-yadda, they ALWAYS have products they want you to buy with the hated government money, which segues nicely to

**4. The Tender For Law**  
Well, this is it. This is what every FreeDumber guru and group has missed.

*This* is why government lawyers can fuck you around endlessly, *this* why there's permits required for any tiny normal thing you can think of, *this* is why you can be thrown in jail for victimless "offences", *this* is why you have to hand over huge chunks of your paycheques... 

... and so you ask "What? WHAT?!? *Why* do they have the right to lick the icing off of every cupcake I bake?".

Becaue you agreed to it.

It says so very clearly, in fact it's printed on the money in your pocket right now. Take out any Canadian banknote, any denomination. If you look carefully you will find this printed somewhere on it:

**THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER**

If you use that money, you are accepting that law. No matter whatever the hell insane bullshit they decide to declare is a law, you agree to, just by using their money.

You see, it's not your money. You earned it, it's in your pocket and you can spend it, but it is not yours. It is someone else's. You have to pay to use someone else's money. It is your masters' money and you must account for what you do with your masters' money.

To quote:

>THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means, "THIS NOTE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW". That is why the group name is so clever. This group is ABOUT that UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW. It's ALL money.

That's from this article [Legalese For Idiots](https://github.com/KentBarr/Articles/blob/master/LEGALESE%20FOR%20IDIOTS.md)

And that's the story of me. If you are new to any of this, I  hope it saves you some time.

Now. I wonder if there's any such thing as a [money that has no tender for law attached to it](https://bitcoin.org/)...
