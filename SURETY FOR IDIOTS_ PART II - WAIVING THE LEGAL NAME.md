THE FOLLOWING is an ENHANCED and TENDER FOR LAW ANNOTATED [In Square Brackets] version of section 2.1 of The ONTARIO "Change of Name Act" [R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER C.7... see what I did there? PAY ATTENTION TO CAPS HERE, as these are the words to look for where YOUR "change of name act" is.]

2. (1) For ALL [ALL purposes! Pay attention to that] purposes of ONTARIO LAW,

(a) a person whose birth is registered in Ontario is ENTITLED [Which means you want to WAIVE this.] to be recognized by the NAME appearing on the PERSON'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE or change of name certificate, unless clause (c) applies;

(b) a person whose birth is not registered in Ontario is ENTITLED[Which means you want to WAIVE this.] to be recognized by,

(i) the name appearing on the person's change of name certificate, if the person's name has been changed under this Act or a predecessor of it, or

(ii) in all other cases, the name recognized in law in the last place with which the person had a real and substantial connection before residing in Ontario,

unless clause (c) applies; and

(c) a person who adopted a name on marriage before the 1st day of April, 1987 is entitled to be recognized by that name unless the person subsequently changed that name under this Act or a predecessor of it. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.7, s. 2 (1).

So always WAIVE the BENEFIT of section 2.1 of the CHANGE OF NAME ACT.

Any name you are known by is PRIVATE, and NOT DERIVED from a PUBLIC DOCUMENT. Don't be surety for a THING.

I WAIVE THE BENEFIT OF SECTION 2.1 OF THE ONTARIO CHANGE OF NAME ACT. BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU ADDRESS ME BY ANY NAME, AND/OR, ANY INFORMATION DERIVED FROM ANY PUBLIC DOCUMENT?
